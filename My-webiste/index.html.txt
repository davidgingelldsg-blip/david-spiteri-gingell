  <h1>Governance, Institutional & Digital Transformation</h1>

  <p>
    I work on the design, assessment, and reform of complex public systems.
    My focus is governance architecture, institutional performance,
    and the role of digital and data systems as instruments of control and accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    I work at system level.
    Structure, incentives, compliance, and long-term outcomes.
    Not commentary. Not slogans.
  </p>

  <p class="muted">
    Intended for policymakers, regulators, boards,
    and institutions dealing with real systems and real consequences.
